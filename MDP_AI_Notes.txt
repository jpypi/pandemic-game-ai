For any end state; there needs to be a "reward"
Rewards:
	an outbreak occurs: -10
	lose the game: -100
	# of color cubes left: - sum[ H(blue), H(red), H(yellow), H(black) ]
		Logistic function H('color')
		x0 = 12
		k = 1
		L = 25
	number of cures: F
		Logistic function F
		x0 = 2
		k = 1
		L = 1000
		
Probabilities Desired
	Probability of an outbreak in City X in turns Y
		we are interested in the probability that City X will have 4 cubes of any color Z in Y turn
	Probability of game over in Y turns 
		we are interested in the probability that we run out of disease cubes of any color Z or we get 8 outbreaks or we run out of turns 
	Probability of drawing City X in turns Y
		what is the chance of City X in turns Y being drawn from the infection pile (top)
	Probability of drawing epidemic infector card of City X in turns Y
		This is only for drawing the bottom card of the deck that gets 3 infections
	Probability of drawing epidemic card in turns Y
	Probability of getting 1 disease cube of color Z in City X
	Probability of cure in Y turns
