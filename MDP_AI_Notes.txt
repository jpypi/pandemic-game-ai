For any end state; there needs to be a "reward"
Rewards:
	an outbreak occurs: -10
	lose the game: -100
	# of color cubes left: - sum[ H(blue), H(red), H(yellow), H(black) ]
		Logistic function H('color')
		x0 = 12
		k = 1
		L = 25
	number of cures: F
		Logistic function F
		x0 = 2
		k = 1
		L = 1000

	Probabilities Desired
	=====================

A = 1 if not in discard; else 0 -> this only holds for the current turn
	This assumes uniform distribution of cards which only holds if it is unknown
P(drawing_city_x | unknown) = 1/infection * A

P(drawing_city_x | unknown, epidemic) = 0 until infection_discard/rate > turn_count; then its back to 1/infection * A

P(drawing_city_x | discard) = 1/(infection_discard+1) * P(drawing_epidemic)

Stack of 6 Cards: X is position 4 at fixed rate2
p(drawing_city_x) = 1/6
p(drawing_city_x | card_1 != x) = ? (this is not 1/5 -> its slightly greater than 1/5)
	

p(drawing_city_x | card_3) = ?
p(drawing_city_x | card_4) = ?

p(drawing_city_x | card_5) = ?
p(drawing_city_x | card_6) = 1

P(drawing_city_x | 3 turns) = 
P(drawing_city_x | 2 turns) = 
P(drawing_city_x | 1 turns) = 
	
Probability of an outbreak in City X in turns Y
	we are interested in the probability that City X will have 4 cubes of any color Z in Y turn
Probability of game over in Y turns 
	we are interested in the probability that we run out of disease cubes of any color Z or we get 8 outbreaks or we run out of turns 
Probability of drawing City X in turns Y
	what is the chance of City X in turns Y being drawn from the infection pile (top)
	if it is currently in the discard pile
		P(dcx) = 0 at that given turn
		P(dcx) = 1/infection_discard * P(eic)
	P(dcx) = 
	
Probability of drawing epidemic infector card of City X in turns Y
	This is only for drawing the bottom card of the deck that gets 3 infections
	If a card has been drawn at any time before; 
		P(eic) = 0 -> this is an approximation but should hold fine 
	else:
		P(eic) = 1/Cards_remaining * 1/(cards_remaining-2) * 1/(cards_remaining-4) * ... * 1/(cards_remaining - 2*(Y-1))
		
Probability of drawing epidemic card in turns Y
	On average 9, 10 or 12 cards on average depending on difficulty or (5,5,6 turns)
	X = starting_card_size (48+5-8+D) or (48+5-9+D)
	slice_size = X/D
	max target = #_of_eps * slice_size (18)
	current_cards_drawn % cards_between
	
	-----
	if X < slice_size && has_drawn_for_slice
		P(epi) = 0
	else 
		P(epi) = 2 / (slice_size - X)
	-----
	
	for instance no epidemics drawn since start and its card 7 and 8; the probability would be 1/3
	however if the card was drawn as 3; there is a chance that not until card 18 it would be drawn be 0


Probability of getting 1 disease cube of color Z in City X
	if z == natural color
		P(obx) = sum_multi(P(obn) for each neighbor of x of color Z)
		p(dc, z, x) = P(dcx) * P(obx)

Probability of cure in Y turns
